Minesweeper version 1.0
Release date: 3 May 2019
Made by Trevor Natiuk

Pretty much emulates the processes of the original minesweeper.
- The option "click the face" is a reference to the original Minesweeper, in which clicking the face would start a new game.
- Uncovering an already-uncovered square will also uncover all surrounding covered squares, provided that the value of the square matches the number of surrounding flags.

Other than that, have fun!
